-- Migration 002: This migration is no longer needed as the columns
-- has_completed_shop_sync, has_completed_vat_setup, and has_completed_invoice_setup
-- are already created in migration 001_create_settings_tables.sql

-- This file is kept for reference but the ALTER TABLE statements have been removed
-- to prevent the "column already exists" error.

-- If you need to add new columns in the future, add them here.
